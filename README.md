A portfolio and blog app/site/platform or whatever people call it these days


## Why diss?

"I wanted to build something and I didn't know what to build."
While that's part of the reason, I also like to share my experiences so that people can make use of it be it good or bad (if they care at all).

Along the way I thought, "why don't I make it my portfolio or profile website?"

And here we are, building it. I've absolutely no idea how I'm gonna build the frontend, I only know HTML and CSS.
If I succeed, I'll update here: `<placeholder>`.
